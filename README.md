### GLX Overview ###

GLX is an experimental fork of P3LX to run LX on top of the LWJGL rather than Processing. The build files have not been cleaned up as of now, and a few things in here may be out of sync or still being ported. I don't recommend anyone work with this just yet.

### Contact and Collaboration ###

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Want to solicit some help, request new framework features, or just ask a random question? Drop me a line: mark@heronarts.com
